haskell-testing-stub
====================

This stub project demonstrates how to organize code tests in a Haskell project.
It shows how to:
  * separate tests from the actual code, so that users don't need to install 
    testing libraries
  * use cabal to automate testing
  * use test-framework to create a coherent test suite containing both HUnit 
    and QuickCheck tests
  * create HUnit tests that run with many different test data sets.
